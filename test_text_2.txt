What a loony. 

Shrek 

Beware 

Stay out 

I think he's in here. 

All right. Lets get it! 

Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? 

Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains. 

Well actually that would be a giant. 

Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse. 

They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin. 

They'll chew your livers, squeeze the jelly from your eyes. 

Actually, it's quite good on toast. 

Back, back beast, back! 

I warned you! 

Right.
